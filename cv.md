## About
Hello! My name is Georgy, I'am beginner Front-end Developer. I learning web development since 2019. Unfortunely, I had to serve in the Belarus army in 2020 and forget all my skills. It's very sad, cause it was my dream to become an IT specialist.
But now I'am ready not only to remember everything I know before, but also to learn something new. I hope the RS School will help me with this.

## Skills
1. __HTML/CSS (Advanced)__
2. __JavaScript (Basic)__
3. __Git/GitHub (Basic)__
